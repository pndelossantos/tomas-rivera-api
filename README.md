#Tomás Rivera Mexican American Children’s Book Award API

Texas State University College of Education developed the Tomás Rivera Mexican American Children’s Book Award to honor authors and illustrators who create literature that depicts the Mexican American experience. The award was established in 1995 and was named in honor of Dr. Tomás Rivera, a distinguished alumnus of Texas State University.

This API contains all award winners since the establishment of the award in 1995.

##How It's Made:
**Tech used:** HTML, JavaScript, Node, Express

This API is was hardcoded using Node and Express. All Tomás Rivera Mexican American Children’s Book Award winners are listed in the API and for each winning book the book's title, author, illustrator, isbn, and synopsis are available*. The front-end of the API is an html page that contains documentation and instructions for accessing API data. As this was an introductory project I spent most of my time becoming more familiar with Node and Express syntax rather than utilizing any additional modules.

##Lessons Learned:
This project was my first attempt at creating a simple API using Node and Express and provided a great hands on introduction into structuring and launching working APIs with minimal tools. In the future use of a database and a web scraper could make the final project better organized and easier to scale, but regardless this project definitely helped cement the express and node syntax for me.
